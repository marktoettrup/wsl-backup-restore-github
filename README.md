# WSL Backup & Restore Toolkit

A user-friendly PowerShell-based solution to **backup, restore, and schedule Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** distributions. This toolkit provides manual and scheduled options for creating `.tar` or `.7z` archives of your WSL environments and restoring them when needed.

## Features

- **Automated WSL backup scheduling** - Will backup all of your installed WSLs
- **Multiple backup options:**
  - Scheduled backup with user prompts (every 14th day)
  - Manual backup trigger at any time
  - Silent scheduled backup (every Sunday at 10:00 AM)
- **Flexible backup formats** - 7z compression (preferred) or .tar files
- **OneDrive integration** - Backups saved to OneDrive for cloud storage
- **Backup rotation** - Keeps the last 5 backups automatically
- **Easy restore** - Simple GUI-driven restore from OneDrive
- **Customizable schedules** - Change backup timing to suit your needs
- **WSL distribution restore functionality**
- **User-friendly setup and uninstall scripts**

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine
2. Open an **elevated PowerShell terminal**
3. Run:

   ```powershell
   ./setup.ps1
   ```

This will install required modules and set up two scheduled tasks:

- `Backup WSL`: Runs every second Monday at 10:00 AM, with full user interaction
- `Backup WSL Silent`: Runs silently every Sunday at 10:00 AM without user prompts
